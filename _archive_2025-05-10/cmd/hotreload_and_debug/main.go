// The goal of this is to have a library or build a library and demo the use of the library in this file that will watch for file
// changes and then reload the connected browsers.
// Additionally, the JavaScript client should be able to report on errors from the console and errors loading javascript files
// to the server so that we can see them in the logs and report them to sentry.
// The server should be queriable to see the connected client errors and their status.
// And other status about the html / javascript files that are loaded.

// THIS IS NOT THE LIBRARY. THIS IS THE DEMO OF THE LIBRARY.
