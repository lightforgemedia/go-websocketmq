Okay, I've reviewed the codebase structure you've provided, which includes Go packages for the broker, client, shared ErgoSockets types, shared application types, and a set of JS tests with a test page and a JS client library (`websocketmq.js`).

My understanding is that you want me to:

1.  **Analyze the Go code** within `pkg/broker`, `pkg/client`, `pkg/ergosockets`, and `pkg/shared_types`.
2.  **Assume the JS client (`websocketmq.js`) and its usage in `test_page.html` correctly implement the client-side logic** corresponding to the Go client library's intended API (e.g., `request`, `subscribe`, `on('request', ...)`). The JS tests (`pkg/js_tests/*.go`) will be used to infer the expected behavior and API surface of this JS client when interacting with the Go broker.
3.  **Apply the Recursive Self-Learning Mandate** to generate a comprehensive Test Plan Specification for the **Go codebase**.
4.  The test plan should enable an AI to generate Go tests that, if passing, would give high confidence in the robustness of the Go server (broker) and the Go client library, particularly their interaction patterns and adherence to the defined API.

I will **not** be analyzing the JavaScript code (`websocketmq.js` or `test_page.html`) for its internal correctness, but rather using the Go tests that drive it (`pkg/js_tests/*.go`) to understand the expected contract and interaction patterns between the JS client and the Go broker. The primary focus of the test plan will be the Go components.

Let's proceed with the analysis and test plan generation.

---

**Comprehensive Test Plan Specification (Generated via Recursive Self-Learning)**

**Generated:** 2025-05-10T22:00:00Z
**Codebase Language:** Go
**Analysis Scope:** Full Go codebase static analysis (`pkg/broker`, `pkg/client`, `pkg/ergosockets`, `pkg/shared_types`) with iterative refinement. JS test interactions inform broker API testing.

**1. Executive Summary & Strategy**

The Go codebase implements a WebSocket messaging system named "ErgoSockets." It comprises:
*   A `broker` package: Manages server-side WebSocket connections, client lifecycle, topic-based subscriptions, and request routing. Key components are `Broker` and `managedClient`.
*   A `client` package: Provides a Go client library for connecting to a WebSocket server (like the ErgoSockets broker), making requests, publishing messages, subscribing to topics, and handling server-initiated requests. The main entity is `Client`.
*   An `ergosockets` package: Contains common types like `Envelope`, `HandlerWrapper`, `Logger` interface, and utility functions.
*   A `shared_types` package: Defines application-level message structures and topic constants, intended for use by both server applications and client applications.

The architecture is clearly designed for real-time, bidirectional communication using structured JSON messages (`Envelope`) over WebSockets. It supports request-response, publish-subscribe, and server-to-client request patterns. The system emphasizes type safety through Go structs for payloads and uses reflection for handler invocation. Concurrency is managed via goroutines and mutexes. The design shows attention to context propagation, error handling, and configurable behaviors like ping intervals and client send buffers.

**Top 3-5 Highest-Risk Areas (Iteratively Refined):**

1.  **Broker's `managedClient` Lifecycle & Concurrency (`broker/broker.go`):** This is the heart of the server. The `readPump`, `writePump`, and `pingLoop` goroutines for each client, along with `removeClient` logic, involve complex state management (client maps, subscription maps) and concurrency control (`sync.Mutex`). Errors here could lead to deadlocks, resource leaks, or incorrect message delivery. *Initial thought: "connection handling." Refinement: The concurrent goroutines per client and their interaction with shared broker state are the specific high-risk elements.*
2.  **Client's Connection Management & Reconnection Logic (`client/client.go`):** The `establishConnection` and `reconnectLoop` involve state transitions, managing underlying WebSocket connections, and re-establishing subscriptions. Failures or race conditions here could leave the client in an inconsistent or permanently disconnected state. *Refinement: Beyond just `Connect`, the entire state machine of connection, disconnection, and reconnection, including pump management (`currentConnPumpCtx`, `currentConnPumpWg`), is critical.*
3.  **Request-Response Correlation (Both Broker & Client):** The `pendingRequests` map in both `managedClient` (for server-to-client requests) and `client.Client` (for client-to-server requests), keyed by correlation IDs, is vital. Mishandling (e.g., leaks, incorrect routing, race conditions on the map) would break this core pattern. *Initial focus was on the `Request` API calls; refined to the underlying correlation mechanism.*
4.  **Message Handling & Reflection (`ergosockets/common.go`, `broker/broker.go`, `client/client.go`):** The `HandlerWrapper` and its use of reflection to call user-provided handlers with specific types. Incorrect type inference, unmarshalling errors, or panics within reflected calls are potential risks. *Refinement: The "magic" of type handling via reflection, while ergonomic, needs thorough testing for various handler signatures and payload types.*
5.  **Slow Client/Subscriber Handling (`broker/broker.go`):** The policy for dealing with clients whose send buffers fill up (`StatusPolicyViolation`). Ensuring this is triggered correctly and doesn't block the broker's publishing loop is crucial for server stability. *This was identified as a specific operational risk that needs dedicated testing.*

**Overall Testing Strategy:**

The strategy will use a mix of unit and integration tests, with a strong emphasis on integration tests to verify the interaction between components.

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   Focus on:
        *   Logic within `ergosockets/common.go` (e.g., `NewHandlerWrapper` for various valid/invalid signatures).
        *   Specific complex functions within `broker/managedClient.go` if their logic can be isolated (e.g., parts of `handleClientRequest` if complex decision trees existed, though current is mostly dispatch).
        *   Specific complex functions within `client/client.go` (e.g., parts of `reconnectLoop` backoff calculation if it were more complex).
    *   *Recursive Analysis Impact:* Initially, I might have aimed for more unit tests on broker/client methods. However, many methods are tightly coupled to the WebSocket connection state or internal maps. The refined strategy focuses unit tests on truly isolatable logic (like the reflection helper) and pushes interaction testing to integration.
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   **Broker-Level (`broker_test.go`):** These will test the `Broker` by simulating client connections using the `github.com/coder/websocket` library directly or by using the implemented `ergosockets/client.Client`. This will verify:
        *   Client connection/disconnection lifecycle.
        *   `OnRequest` handler invocation and correct request/response flow.
        *   `Publish` to `Subscribe` flow for one or more clients.
        *   Server-to-client `Request` via `ClientHandle`.
        *   Slow client disconnection.
        *   Ping/pong keep-alive from server.
    *   **Client-Level (`client_test.go`):** These will test the `Client` against a `mockServer` (as provided in the test scaffolding). This will verify:
        *   `Connect` and `Close`.
        *   `Request[T]` success, error, and timeout paths.
        *   `Publish` functionality.
        *   `Subscribe` and `Unsubscribe`, including message reception.
        *   `OnRequest` (for server-initiated requests to client) invocation.
        *   Auto-reconnection logic (by simulating server disconnects).
    *   *Recursive Analysis Impact:* The `js_tests` provided strong hints about the expected broker-client interaction patterns, reinforcing the need for robust integration tests covering these scenarios from a Go perspective as well. The interaction points (request/response, pub/sub) are where the most significant application value lies.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
    *   Involve running the example `server/main.go` and `client/main.go` applications as separate processes (or goroutines simulating processes) and verifying their combined behavior. These tests will be very similar to the broker-level integration tests that use the `ergosockets/client.Client`, but they validate the application's wiring and configuration of the library components.

**Key Areas Requiring Mocking/Test Doubles:**
*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   `ergosockets/common.go`: No direct mocks needed, test with various function signatures.
    *   `broker/managedClient.go` (if testing parts in isolation): `*websocket.Conn`, `*broker.Broker`.
    *   `client/client.go` (if testing parts in isolation): `*websocket.Conn`.
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   `client_test.go`: The `mockServer` is already designed for this, acting as the WebSocket peer.
    *   `broker_test.go`: Uses `httptest.NewServer` and actual WebSocket connections, potentially using the `ergosockets/client.Client` as the peer.

**Limitations Note:**
This test plan is based on static analysis of the provided Go codebase. It cannot cover:
*   Runtime behavior under specific OS/network conditions not inferable from code structure (e.g., actual network latency, packet loss effects on reconnection).
*   Specific data-driven edge cases not obvious from the code's structure (e.g., extremely large payloads, unusual Unicode characters if not handled by `wsjson`).
*   Requirement mismatches (i.e., if the code implements something different from an unstated requirement for ErgoSockets).
*   Deep security vulnerabilities (e.g., specific DoS vectors beyond basic slow client handling, authentication/authorization which are not part of this library's core).
*   True load/performance characteristics; these require dedicated performance testing.
*   Correctness of the underlying `github.com/coder/websocket` library.

**2. Prioritized Unit Test Specifications**

**Target Entity:** `ergosockets/common.go - NewHandlerWrapper(handlerFunc interface{})`
**Priority:** Critical
**Rationale:** Core reflection logic for adapting user functions. Incorrect parsing of signatures breaks all handler registrations. Refined analysis shows this is a central utility with high impact if faulty.
**Suggested Test Cases/Scenarios (Refined & Specific):**
1.  **Valid Server `OnRequest` Signatures:**
    *   `func(broker.ClientHandle, app_shared_types.GetTimeRequest) (app_shared_types.GetTimeResponse, error)` -> Assert `ReqType`, `RespType` are correct, `MsgType` is nil.
    *   `func(broker.ClientHandle, app_shared_types.GetUserDetailsRequest) error` (no response payload) -> Assert `ReqType` correct, `RespType` is nil.
    *   `func(broker.ClientHandle, *app_shared_types.GetUserDetailsRequest) (*app_shared_types.UserDetailsResponse, error)` (pointer types) -> Assert `ReqType`, `RespType` are correct pointer types.
2.  **Valid Client `Subscribe` Signature:**
    *   `func(app_shared_types.ServerAnnouncement) error` -> Assert `MsgType` correct, `ReqType`/`RespType` nil.
    *   `func(*app_shared_types.ServerAnnouncement) error` (pointer type) -> Assert `MsgType` correct pointer type.
3.  **Valid Client `OnRequest` Signatures:**
    *   `func(app_shared_types.ClientStatusQuery) (app_shared_types.ClientStatusReport, error)` -> Assert `ReqType`, `RespType` correct.
    *   `func(*app_shared_types.ClientStatusQuery) error` (pointer request, no response payload) -> Assert `ReqType` correct pointer type, `RespType` nil.
4.  **Invalid Signatures:**
    *   Not a function.
    *   Does not return `error` as the last argument.
    *   Incorrect number of arguments for known patterns (e.g., 0 args, 3 args for server `OnRequest`).
    *   Argument types are interfaces (e.g., `func(interface{}) error` for subscribe - currently disallowed by implementation).
    *   Return types are interfaces for payload (e.g., `func() (interface{}, error)` - currently disallowed).
**Mocking Needs:** None. Pass actual function literals.
**State Verification (if applicable):** N/A. Verify returned `HandlerWrapper` fields.

**Target Entity:** `ergosockets/common.go - GenerateID()`
**Priority:** Medium
**Rationale:** Ensures unique IDs for requests; failure could lead to misrouted responses. Simple function but important.
**Suggested Test Cases/Scenarios (Refined & Specific):**
1.  **ID Format:** Assert returned ID is a hex string of expected length (32 chars for 16 bytes).
2.  **Uniqueness (Probabilistic):** Call multiple times, assert IDs are different.
**Mocking Needs:** None.
**State Verification (if applicable):** N/A.

**Target Entity:** `ergosockets/envelope.go - Envelope methods`
**Priority:** Medium
**Rationale:** Correct serialization/deserialization of the message envelope is fundamental.
**Suggested Test Cases/Scenarios (Refined & Specific):**
1.  **`NewEnvelope` with Payload:**
    *   Provide various `payloadData` (struct, map, primitive).
    *   Assert `Envelope.Payload` contains correctly marshalled JSON.
    *   Assert `Envelope.Type`, `Topic`, `ID` are set.
2.  **`NewEnvelope` with nil Payload:**
    *   Pass `nil` for `payloadData`.
    *   Assert `Envelope.Payload` is `nil` (which will marshal to JSON `null`).
3.  **`NewEnvelope` with Error:**
    *   Provide `errPayload`.
    *   Assert `Envelope.Error` is correctly populated.
4.  **`Envelope.DecodePayload`:**
    *   `Envelope` with valid JSON payload -> Unmarshal into a compatible struct pointer. Assert success and correct values.
    *   `Envelope` with valid JSON payload -> Unmarshal into an incompatible struct pointer. Assert error.
    *   `Envelope` with malformed JSON in `Payload`. Assert error.
    *   `Envelope` with `Payload` being JSON `null` -> Unmarshal into struct pointer. Assert no error, struct is zeroed.
    *   `Envelope` with `Payload` being JSON `null` -> Unmarshal into `*interface{}`. Assert no error, result is nil.
**Mocking Needs:** None.
**State Verification (if applicable):** N/A.

*(Self-correction: Unit testing individual methods of `broker/managedClient.go` or `client/client.go` like `readPump` or `writePump` in true isolation is very difficult due to their tight coupling with the `websocket.Conn` and internal state/channels. Their core logic is better tested via integration tests where these pumps are naturally exercised. Focus unit tests on utilities or pure logic if any were more complex.)*

**3. Prioritized Integration Test Specifications**

**Integration Point:** Broker: Client Connection, Ping/Pong, and Disconnection Lifecycle
**Priority:** Critical
**Entities Involved:** `broker.Broker`, `broker.managedClient` (internally), `websocket.Conn` (simulated by a test client).
**Rationale:** Fundamental to server stability and resource management. Validates server pings, read deadlines, and cleanup. Refined analysis highlights `removeClient` and pump coordination as key.
**Suggested Test Scenarios:**
1.  **Successful Connect and Ping:**
    *   Test client connects. Broker registers `managedClient`.
    *   If server pings enabled (`broker.config.pingInterval > 0`):
        *   Wait for server to send Ping. Test client (or mock `websocket.Conn`) auto-responds with Pong.
        *   Assert connection remains active.
        *   Assert `managedClient.readPump` refreshes read deadline on Pong.
2.  **Client Graceful Disconnect:**
    *   Test client connects, then sends WebSocket close frame.
    *   Assert `broker.removeClient` is called for that client.
    *   Assert client is removed from `managedClients` and `publishSubscribers`.
    *   Assert `managedClient`'s context is cancelled.
3.  **Client Abrupt Disconnect (Simulated Read/Write Error):**
    *   Test client connects.
    *   Simulate a `websocket.Conn` error during `wsjson.Read` in `managedClient.readPump` (e.g., by closing the connection from the test client side abruptly, or mock `conn.ReadMessage` to return error).
    *   Assert `broker.removeClient` is called.
    *   Assert resources are cleaned up.
4.  **Read Timeout Disconnect (No Pongs/Messages):**
    *   Configure broker with `pingInterval < 0` (disabled) and a short `readTimeout`.
    *   Test client connects but sends no data and does not respond to pings (if pings were on but pong handler faulty).
    *   Assert `managedClient.readPump` times out due to read deadline.
    *   Assert `broker.removeClient` is called.
5.  **Ping Timeout Disconnect (Server Pings, Client Unresponsive):**
    *   Configure broker with `pingInterval > 0`.
    *   Test client connects but its `websocket.Conn` is mocked to *not* respond to Pings.
    *   Assert `managedClient.pingLoop` detects Ping failure.
    *   Assert connection is closed by `pingLoop` and `broker.removeClient` is called.
**Key Interactions to Verify:**
*   `websocket.Accept` in `UpgradeHandler`.
*   `addClient`, `removeClient` logic.
*   `managedClient` goroutine (read, write, ping) lifecycle and context cancellation.
*   Read deadline and Pong handler interaction in `managedClient.readPump`.
*   Ping mechanism in `managedClient.pingLoop`.

**Integration Point:** Broker: Request Handling (`broker.OnRequest`)
**Priority:** Critical
**Entities Involved:** `broker.Broker`, `broker.managedClient`, test client sending requests.
**Rationale:** Core request-response pattern for server. Validates routing, handler invocation, payload marshalling/unmarshalling, and error propagation.
**Suggested Test Scenarios:**
1.  **Valid Request, Handler Returns Payload:**
    *   Broker registers handler for `topicA` that expects `TypeA`, returns `TypeB`.
    *   Client sends valid `TypeRequest` envelope on `topicA` with `TypeA` payload.
    *   Assert server handler invoked with correct `ClientHandle` and deserialized `TypeA`.
    *   Assert client receives `TypeResponse` envelope with `TypeB` payload.
2.  **Valid Request, Handler Returns Only Error (Success):**
    *   Broker registers handler for `topicB` that expects `TypeC`, returns `nil` error.
    *   Client sends request on `topicB` with `TypeC` payload and an `ID`.
    *   Assert server handler invoked.
    *   Assert client receives `TypeResponse` envelope with original `ID` and `null` or no payload (acknowledgment).
3.  **Valid Request, Handler Returns Error:**
    *   Broker registers handler for `topicC` that returns an `error`.
    *   Client sends request on `topicC`.
    *   Assert server handler invoked.
    *   Assert client receives `TypeError` envelope with original `ID` and error details from handler.
4.  **Request to Unregistered Topic:**
    *   Client sends request to `topicUnk`.
    *   Assert client receives `TypeError` envelope with `http.StatusNotFound` or similar.
5.  **Malformed Request Payload from Client:**
    *   Client sends request with `Payload` that cannot be unmarshalled into handler's `ReqType`.
    *   Assert client receives `TypeError` envelope with `http.StatusBadRequest` or similar.
6.  **Server Handler Fails to Marshal Response:**
    *   Handler returns a `RespType` that `json.Marshal` fails on (e.g., contains a channel).
    *   Assert client receives `TypeError` envelope indicating server-side error.
7.  **Request with No Payload (to handler expecting empty struct or using variadic):**
    *   Client sends request with `payload: null`. Handler expects `shared_types.GetTimeRequest{}`.
    *   Assert handler invoked correctly.
**Key Interactions to Verify:**
*   `managedClient.readPump` dispatching to `handleClientRequest`.
*   `handleClientRequest` looking up handler in `broker.requestHandlers`.
*   Payload unmarshalling into handler's `ReqType`.
*   Handler invocation with correct arguments.
*   Response/error marshalling into `Envelope` and sending via `managedClient.trySend`.

**Integration Point:** Broker: Publish/Subscribe (`broker.Publish`, client subscribes)
**Priority:** Critical
**Entities Involved:** `broker.Broker`, `broker.managedClient`, one or more test clients.
**Rationale:** Core pub/sub pattern. Validates topic subscription, message fan-out.
**Suggested Test Scenarios:**
1.  **Single Subscriber:**
    *   Client A subscribes to `topicX` (sends `TypeSubscribeRequest`).
    *   Assert server's `handleSubscribeRequest` adds client to `publishSubscribers`.
    *   Assert Client A receives `TypeSubscriptionAck`.
    *   Broker publishes message M1 on `topicX`.
    *   Assert Client A receives M1.
2.  **Multiple Subscribers:**
    *   Clients A, B, C subscribe to `topicX`. Client D subscribes to `topicY`.
    *   Broker publishes M2 on `topicX`.
    *   Assert A, B, C receive M2. Assert D does not.
    *   Broker publishes M3 on `topicY`.
    *   Assert D receives M3. Assert A, B, C do not.
3.  **Publish to Topic with No Subscribers:**
    *   Broker publishes to `topicZ` (no subscribers).
    *   Assert no errors, broker logs "no subscribers" (or similar).
4.  **Client Unsubscribes:**
    *   Client A subscribes to `topicX`, then unsubscribes (sends `TypeUnsubscribeRequest`).
    *   Assert server's `handleUnsubscribeRequest` removes client.
    *   Broker publishes M4 on `topicX`.
    *   Assert Client A does *not* receive M4.
5.  **Subscriber Disconnects:**
    *   Client A subscribes to `topicX`.
    *   Client A disconnects.
    *   Assert Client A is removed from `publishSubscribers` for `topicX` (via `removeClient`).
**Key Interactions to Verify:**
*   `managedClient.readPump` dispatching to `handleSubscribeRequest`/`handleUnsubscribeRequest`.
*   Correct manipulation of `broker.publishSubscribers` map.
*   `broker.Publish` correctly iterating and sending to subscribed `managedClient`s.

**Integration Point:** Broker: Slow Client Handling during Publish
**Priority:** High
**Entities Involved:** `broker.Broker`, one slow test client, one fast test client.
**Rationale:** Ensures server stability when one client cannot keep up. Validates `WithClientSendBuffer` and `StatusPolicyViolation` close. Refined analysis identified this as a key resilience test.
**Suggested Test Scenarios:**
1.  **Slow Client Disconnected, Fast Client Unaffected:**
    *   Configure broker with small `clientSendBuffer` (e.g., 1 or 2).
    *   Client Slow subscribes to `topicFlood`. Client Fast also subscribes.
    *   Client Slow's `websocket.Conn` is mocked/controlled to *not read* messages, causing its `managedClient.send` channel on broker to fill.
    *   Broker rapidly publishes many messages to `topicFlood`.
    *   Assert Client Slow's `managedClient.writePump` (or `Broker.Publish`'s send attempt to it) detects full buffer and eventually closes connection with `websocket.StatusPolicyViolation`.
    *   Assert `broker.removeClient` is called for Client Slow.
    *   Assert Client Fast continues to receive messages without issue.
**Key Interactions to Verify:**
*   `Broker.Publish` attempting to send to `managedClient.send`.
*   `managedClient.writePump` handling full `send` channel (this is the refined point: the `Publish` loop itself should not block; the `writePump` of the slow client is the one that should detect it can't write to the actual `websocket.Conn` and then close itself, or the `Publish` loop's `default` case for a full `send` channel should trigger the `closeSlow` equivalent). *Self-correction: The original `chatServer` example's `Publish` has a `default: go s.closeSlow()`. ErgoSockets `Broker.Publish` has a `default:` that logs. The actual close for `StatusPolicyViolation` should happen in `managedClient.writePump` if it repeatedly fails to write to `websocket.Conn` because the client isn't reading, or if `mc.send` is full and `Publish` decides to kick it.* The most direct way is if `mc.send` is full, the `Publish` loop should trigger the close.
    *   *Refined check:* The `Broker.Publish` loop's `default` case (when `mc.send` is full) should log and potentially trigger `mc.closeSlow()` or `broker.removeClient(mc)` non-blockingly. The `managedClient.writePump` will also error out if `wsjson.Write` blocks too long or fails, leading to `removeClient`. The test should verify the `StatusPolicyViolation` if the `Publish` loop initiates the close due to a persistently full `send` channel.

**Integration Point:** Client: Connection Lifecycle & Auto-Reconnect
**Priority:** Critical
**Entities Involved:** `client.Client`, `mockServer`.
**Rationale:** Core client resilience feature.
**Suggested Test Scenarios:**
1.  **Successful Initial Connect:** Covered by other tests.
2.  **Connect Fails (Server Down), No Reconnect:**
    *   `mockServer` is off. Client configured with `autoReconnect = false`.
    *   `client.Connect()` fails, returns error.
3.  **Connect Fails (Server Down), Auto-Reconnect Enabled:**
    *   `mockServer` is off. Client configured with `autoReconnect = true`, few attempts, short delays.
    *   `client.Connect()` might return client instance but in disconnected state (or error, TBD by final API).
    *   Assert client logs reconnection attempts.
    *   Start `mockServer`.
    *   Assert client eventually connects.
    *   Make a successful `cli.Request[T]` after reconnect.
4.  **Connection Drop, Successful Reconnect:**
    *   Client connects to `mockServer`.
    *   Client makes a successful request.
    *   `mockServer` closes the WebSocket connection abruptly.
    *   Assert client detects disconnect and starts reconnecting (logs).
    *   Assert client successfully reconnects.
    *   Assert client can make another successful request.
    *   Assert client re-subscribes to topics it was subscribed to before disconnect (if `resubscribeAll` is effective).
5.  **Reconnect Max Attempts Reached:**
    *   `mockServer` remains off. Client configured with `autoReconnect = true`, `reconnectAttempts = 3`.
    *   Client attempts to connect, fails, retries 3 times.
    *   Assert client stops retrying and enters a permanently closed/failed state.
    *   Assert `cli.Close()` might have been called internally or subsequent operations fail clearly.
6.  **Reconnect Jitter:** (Hard to assert precisely, observe logs for varying delays if possible).
**Key Interactions to Verify:**
*   `client.establishConnection` logic.
*   `client.reconnectLoop` (backoff, jitter, max attempts).
*   State of `client.conn` and pumps during transitions.
*   `client.resubscribeAll` functionality.

**Integration Point:** Client: Request-Response (`cli.Request[T]`)
**Priority:** Critical
**Entities Involved:** `client.Client`, `mockServer`.
**Rationale:** Primary way client gets data from server.
**Suggested Test Cases/Scenarios (Refined & Specific):**
1.  **Successful Request (No Payload In, Payload Out):**
    *   `mockServer` expects request on `topicA`, will send `RespA`.
    *   `cli.Request[RespA](ctx, "topicA")`. Assert correct `*RespA` received.
2.  **Successful Request (Payload In, Payload Out):**
    *   `mockServer` expects `ReqB` on `topicB`, will send `RespB`.
    *   `cli.Request[RespB](ctx, "topicB", ReqBData)`. Assert correct `*RespB`.
3.  **Server Returns Error Envelope:**
    *   `mockServer` expects request on `topicC`, will send `TypeError` envelope.
    *   `cli.Request[RespC](ctx, "topicC")`. Assert error returned by `cli.Request` reflects server error.
4.  **Request Timeout (Server Slow/No Response):**
    *   `mockServer` receives request on `topicD` but never responds.
    *   `cli.Request[RespD](ctx, "topicD")` (with `ctx` having a short timeout, or relying on client's default). Assert timeout error.
5.  **Context Cancellation During Request:**
    *   Client sends request. Before server responds, cancel the `ctx` passed to `cli.Request`.
    *   Assert `cli.Request` returns context cancellation error.
6.  **Malformed Response Payload from Server:**
    *   `mockServer` sends `TypeResponse` but `Payload` is bad JSON or doesn't match `RespT`.
    *   `cli.Request[RespT](...)`. Assert unmarshalling error.
7.  **Response Payload is JSON `null`:**
    *   `mockServer` sends `TypeResponse` with `payload: null`.
    *   `cli.Request[EmptyStruct]`: Assert success, `*EmptyStruct{}` received.
    *   `cli.Request[*Point]`: Assert success, `nil` (*Point) received.
    *   `cli.Request[NonEmptyStruct]`: Assert error (unless `NonEmptyStruct` handles `null` specially).
**Key Interactions to Verify:**
*   `client.Request[T]` internal logic: context handling, `Envelope` creation, `pendingRequests` map usage, response `Envelope` processing, unmarshalling into `*T`.

**Integration Point:** Client: Publish/Subscribe/Unsubscribe
**Priority:** Critical
**Entities Involved:** `client.Client`, `mockServer`.
**Rationale:** Core async communication patterns.
**Suggested Test Cases/Scenarios (Refined & Specific):**
1.  **`cli.Publish`:**
    *   Client calls `cli.Publish("topicP", PayloadP)`.
    *   `mockServer` asserts it receives `TypePublish` envelope on `topicP` with correct payload.
    *   Client calls `cli.Publish("topicQ", nil)` (nil payload).
    *   `mockServer` asserts it receives `TypePublish` envelope on `topicQ` with `payload: null`.
2.  **`cli.Subscribe` and Message Reception:**
    *   Client calls `cli.Subscribe("topicS", handlerS)`.
    *   `mockServer` asserts it receives `TypeSubscribeRequest` on `topicS`.
    *   `mockServer` sends `TypeSubscriptionAck`.
    *   `mockServer` sends `TypePublish` envelope on `topicS` with `PayloadS`.
    *   Assert client's `handlerS` is invoked with correctly unmarshalled `PayloadS`.
3.  **`unsubscribeFunc`:**
    *   Client subscribes, gets `unsubFunc`.
    *   `unsubFunc()` is called.
    *   `mockServer` asserts it receives `TypeUnsubscribeRequest` on the topic.
    *   `mockServer` sends another message on that topic.
    *   Assert client's handler is *not* called.
4.  **Multiple Subscriptions:** Client subscribes to `topicS1` and `topicS2`. Verify messages for each are routed to correct handler.
**Key Interactions to Verify:**
*   `cli.Publish` creating and sending `TypePublish` envelope.
*   `cli.Subscribe` sending `TypeSubscribeRequest`, registering handler.
*   `client.readPump` dispatching `TypePublish` envelopes to correct subscription handler.
*   `unsubscribeFunc` sending `TypeUnsubscribeRequest` and removing handler.

**Integration Point:** Client: Handling Server-Initiated Requests (`cli.OnRequest`)
**Priority:** High
**Entities Involved:** `client.Client`, `mockServer`.
**Rationale:** Validates bidirectional RPC.
**Suggested Test Cases/Scenarios (Refined & Specific):**
1.  **Valid Server Request, Client Handler Returns Payload:**
    *   Client registers handler for `topicServReqA` that expects `ServReqA`, returns `CliRespA`.
    *   `mockServer` sends `TypeRequest` envelope on `topicServReqA` with `ServReqA` payload.
    *   Assert client handler invoked.
    *   Assert `mockServer` receives `TypeResponse` envelope with `CliRespA` payload.
2.  **Valid Server Request, Client Handler Returns Error:**
    *   Client registers handler for `topicServReqB` that returns an `error`.
    *   `mockServer` sends request on `topicServReqB`.
    *   Assert client handler invoked.
    *   Assert `mockServer` receives `TypeError` envelope with error details.
3.  **Server Request to Unregistered Topic on Client:**
    *   `mockServer` sends request to `topicServUnk`.
    *   Assert `mockServer` receives `TypeError` envelope from client indicating "no handler".
**Key Interactions to Verify:**
*   `client.readPump` dispatching `TypeRequest` to `invokeClientRequestHandler`.
*   `invokeClientRequestHandler` looking up handler, unmarshalling, calling, marshalling response/error.

**4. Suggested End-to-End (E2E) Flow Specifications**

**E2E Flow:** Full Client-Server Interaction Demo
**Priority:** Critical
**Entry Point(s):** `server/main.go`, `client/main.go`.
**Key Components Involved (Refined Path):** All components in `broker`, `client`, `ergosockets`, `shared_types` as exercised by the example applications.
**Rationale:** Validates the primary use cases shown in the example applications work together as a system.
**Suggested Scenarios:**
1.  **Standard Flow:**
    *   Start `server/main.go`.
    *   Start `client/main.go`.
    *   Assert client connects (logs).
    *   Assert client successfully requests and logs time from server.
    *   Assert client successfully requests and logs user details for "user123".
    *   Assert client logs an error when requesting details for "user999".
    *   Wait for client to receive and log at least two `ServerAnnouncement` messages.
    *   (Harder to orchestrate E2E) If server could be triggered to send `client:get_status` request to the connected client, assert client handles and logs it.
    *   Assert client logs expected pass/fail for `TopicErrorTest` scenarios.
    *   Assert client logs expected timeout for `TopicSlowServerRequest`.
2.  **Client Reconnects to Server:**
    *   Start `server/main.go`.
    *   Start `client/main.go` (configured for auto-reconnect).
    *   Verify initial interactions (e.g., get time).
    *   Stop `server/main.go`.
    *   Assert client logs disconnection and reconnection attempts.
    *   Restart `server/main.go`.
    *   Assert client eventually reconnects.
    *   Assert client can again successfully request time.
    *   Assert client starts receiving `ServerAnnouncement` messages again.
**Configuration Dependencies:** Server on `localhost:8080`, client connects to this.

**5. Regression Testing Scope Guidance (Based on Refined Dependency Analysis)**

**Guidance:** Changes in core packages (`ergosockets`, `broker`, `client`) have wide-ranging impact. Changes in `shared_types` affect the contract.

*   **Modifying `ergosockets/envelope.go` or `ergosockets/common.go` (e.g., `HandlerWrapper`):**
    *   **Impact:** High. Affects all message processing, handler invocation on both client and broker.
    *   **Regression Scope:** Run ALL unit and integration tests for broker and client. Full E2E.
    *   **Rationale (Refined):** These are foundational. `Envelope` is the wire format contract. `HandlerWrapper` is central to dispatch.

*   **Modifying `broker/broker.go` (e.g., `Publish`, `OnRequest`, connection management in `UpgradeHandler`):**
    *   **Impact:** High for server-side behavior and client interactions with the broker.
    *   **Regression Scope:** All broker integration tests. Client integration tests that rely on specific broker behaviors being tested (e.g., if testing client reconnect, broker's disconnect handling is implicitly part of it). E2E tests.
    *   **Rationale (Refined):** Broker core logic changes can affect all connected clients.

*   **Modifying `broker/managedClient.go` (e.g., `readPump`, `writePump`, `handleClientRequest`):**
    *   **Impact:** High for individual client session stability and message processing on the server for that client.
    *   **Regression Scope:** Broker integration tests focusing on single and multiple client scenarios, especially those testing lifecycle, slow clients, and request/response processing. E2E tests.
    *   **Rationale (Refined):** This is the per-client workhorse on the server.

*   **Modifying `client/client.go` (e.g., `Request[T]`, `Subscribe`, `reconnectLoop`, pumps):**
    *   **Impact:** High for all client application functionality.
    *   **Regression Scope:** All client integration tests. E2E tests.
    *   **Rationale (Refined):** Client library core logic changes affect any application using it.

*   **Modifying `shared_types/types.go`:**
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Breaks the data contract between client and server if not updated in sync.
    *   **Regression Scope:** All tests that use the modified type(s) or topics. This often means most integration and E2E tests.
    *   **Rationale (Refined):** This is the API contract for data. Any change here is effectively a breaking change if not coordinated.

**Example:** If `ergosockets.Envelope` struct changes a field name (e.g., `ID` to `CorrelationID`):
1.  All `NewEnvelope` calls and direct struct access must be updated in `broker` and `client` packages.
2.  All `wsjson.Read/Write` calls implicitly rely on this structure.
3.  All tests verifying request-response (which use the ID) would need to be checked/updated.
4.  This would necessitate running virtually all tests.
*Rationale (Refined):* The `Envelope` is the absolute wire protocol. Changing it is a fundamental shift.

**6. Specific Areas Requiring Attention (Identified through Refined Analysis)**

*   **Potential Test Coverage Gaps (Heuristic):**
    *   **Concurrent `Client.Request[T]` calls:** Ensure the `pendingRequests` map and response routing in the client are robust under concurrent requests from the application.
    *   **Concurrent `Broker.Publish` and client subscribe/unsubscribe:** Test for race conditions in `publishSubscribers` map modifications while publishing.
    *   **Broker Shutdown Robustness:** Test `Broker.Shutdown` under various states (e.g., clients actively sending, clients disconnecting, no clients). Ensure all client goroutines (`managedClient` pumps) are reliably terminated. *Refinement: Shutdown is often an afterthought but critical for resource cleanup.*
    *   **Client `Close()` Robustness:** Test `Client.Close` during various states (connecting, reconnecting, active pumps). Ensure all client-side goroutines stop cleanly.
    *   **Type Mismatches in Reflection:** While `NewHandlerWrapper` does some checks, more specific tests for how `invoke...Handler` functions behave with subtle type differences (e.g., `int` vs `int32` in payload vs. handler struct) could be beneficial, though `json.Unmarshal` handles much of this.
*   **High Global State Interaction:** The `ergosockets.errType` and `ergosockets.timeNow` are package-level variables. `timeNow` is for testability. `errType` is a cached type. Low risk. The main "global-like" state is within Broker/Client instances (maps), protected by mutexes.
*   **Potential Resource Management Issues:**
    *   **Goroutine Leaks:** Primary concern in `managedClient` pumps and `client.Client` pumps if context cancellation is not perfectly propagated or `WaitGroups` are misused during reconnects/shutdowns. Tests should try to detect these (e.g., by checking active goroutine counts before/after tests, though this is hard in standard Go tests).
    *   **Channel Closing:** Ensure `pendingRequests` channels are not leaked if a request context times out before the response channel is used. The `defer delete/close` in `client.Request` aims to handle this.
*   **Circular Dependencies Detected:** None apparent at the package level.
*   **Refactoring Candidates:**
    *   `broker/managedClient.go - handleClientRequest` and `client/client.go - invokeClientRequestHandler / invokeSubscriptionHandler`: These methods involving `reflect.Call` are complex. While necessary for the generic handler API, they are dense. No immediate refactoring is obvious without changing the generic handler approach, but they are areas to watch for bugs.
    *   `client/client.go - establishConnection` and `reconnectLoop`: The state management around connection pumps (`currentConnPumpCtx`, `currentConnPumpCancel`, `currentConnPumpWg`) during reconnects is intricate. Careful review during implementation and thorough testing (as planned) is key. *Refinement: The interaction between `Close()`, `establishConnection()`, and `reconnectLoop()` regarding pump lifecycle and context management is a complex state machine.*
